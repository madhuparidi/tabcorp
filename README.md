Tabcorp Bet Api
Instructions to start the application:
1. Navigate to the folder with pom.xml 
2. type mvnw ./springboot:run

Assumptions:
1. HATEOS REST API is not considered as a mandatory requirement.
2. Security through  OAuth2.0 with JWT propagation is out of scope. This will enable a true serverless design to make this microservice scalable.

TODO:
1. JSON API standard request/response for implementing resource based REST API
2. Expose a Reactive Experiance API on top of data API to cater multiple front end clients (mobile,web) with good response times.
